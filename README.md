## Overview

Colourix is a fictitious company of art utensils and a color manufacturer.
The purpose of the e-commerce application is to broaden the network of clients and enter new markets. Colourix is looking for a new e-commerce website. <br>
Prototype Quote - consists of a web app to be both user-friendly and also for the design to reflect them as a brand.<br>
The project includes developing a prototype of what an e-commerce website for Colourix can look like. Before Colourix buys the website they want to see a prototype in order to see if our team can meet their visions and requirements.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Understand the value of Colourix as a brand and service provider.
-   Easily navigate the web application to view products, understand and recieve promotion benefits/discounts,
    and experience a positive, informative step-by-step purchase and checkout procedure.

## Our process

Walking through the criteria for the assignment as a group, in order to create a step-by-step workflow and visualize the project challenges and structure. Distributing the individual responsibilities as well as taking decisions for design and layout. Additionally to identify the challenges that would need a read-up and further studies to be able to implement it/them into the project.<br>
Alongside the development, there have been group discussions and sessions for general support and troubleshooting.

### Built with

-   HTML5 markup
-   CSS3
-   Flexbox
-   Desktop-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   Responsive design
-   Figma

### What we learned

React Routing - how to address a multipage web application with data flowing between pages and managing links.<br>
Manage State - how to address the flow of data between components and parent/child in up/down direction effectively.<br>
Reusable components - how to build reusable multi-functional components throughout the application.

### Continued development

Continue improving responsive design for smaller screens.
Extend the web application to collect data from Api instead of a hard-coded data file. Further, develop the checkout to include tax and shipping cost, and collect user information for shipping. Implement a possibility for client registration and a user login section with password verification. Form e-mail verification. Furthermore, to implement semantic markup, SEO and address accessibility issues.
